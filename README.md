# Image-Proccessing

In this repository, i have shown how we can use opencv to improve the visibility of an image which is clicked in dark environment using various opencv methods.

Let's see this with an example:
![alt text](https://github.com/ajinkyagholape1998/Image-Proccessing/blob/master/Image%20Processing/guioutput.png)
As we can see in the left image,It's very difficult to read out what's written on the image, But in right hand side image we are able to read.
This is done using Adaptive thresholding and we can change the threshold value using scale, this makes it very easy to adjust the threshold value for various images that could be captured in various light conditions.
